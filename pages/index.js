              The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City, colloquially "the Met", is the largest art museum in
              the Americas. Its permanent collection contains over two million works, divided among 17 curatorial
              departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue, along the Museum Mile on the eastern edge of
              Central Park on Manhattan's Upper East Side, is by area one of the world's largest art museums. A
              much smaller second location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive
              collection of art, architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe.

              The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 with its mission to bring art and art education to the
              American people. The museum's permanent collection consists of works of art from classical antiquity and
              ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures from nearly all the European masters, and an extensive collection
              of American and modern art. The Met maintains extensive holdings of African, Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine,
              and Islamic art. The museum is home to encyclopedic collections of musical instruments, costumes, and
              accessories, as well as antique weapons and armor from around the world. Several notable interiors,
              ranging from 1st-century Rome through modern American design, are installed in its galleries.
